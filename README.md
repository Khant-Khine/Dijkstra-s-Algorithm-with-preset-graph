# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-with-preset-graph
This is an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm with a preset graph. The user will enter a starting and ending point and will be presented with the shortest path. Future implementation for ad-hoc networks with Dijkstra's algorithm, to be used in disaster management systems, is the ultimate goal of this project.
